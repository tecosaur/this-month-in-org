A discussion on contributor support
═══════════════════════════════════

  Concerns [were raised][1] about some contributors' patches
  languishing, and it not being made clear how long it might take to get
  a response from someone.

  In [response to this], a the new role of /Contributor Steward/ has
  been created to: help ensure contributors get a timely response, help
  out with preliminary patch feedback, and keep [updates.orgmode.org] up
  to date.

  Org now has three Contributor Stewards to ease the process for patch
  submitters and core maintainers:
  ⁃ Timothy / TEC
  ⁃ Tim Cross
  ⁃ John Corless

  If you've been thinking about [getting involved with Org], now is a
  great time to give it a shot!

  *Ways you can contribute to the project*

  Test patches, improve documentation, translate pages, confirm bugs,
  feedback on a proposed feature, and more…

DOI link exporting
══════════════════

  [Digital Document Identifiers] (DOIs) are an ISO-standardised way of
  robustly linking to a particular online resource. You'll see these a
  lot with academic papers, for example.

  Thanks to Nicolas Goaziou, when exporting to HTML, LaTeX, Ascii, and
  texinfo DOIs are turned into links, for example
  <https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v046.i03> becomes:

  ┌────
  │ <a href="https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v046.i03">doi:10.18637/jss.v046.i03</a>
  └────
  ┌────
  │ \href{https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v046.i03}{doi:10.18637/jss.v046.i03}
  └────
  ┌────
  │ <https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v046.i03>
  └────
  ┌────
  │ @uref{https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v046.i03}
  └────

  This is a minor change, but I think DOIs are great, so I'm
  highlighting it.

Org plot improvements
═════════════════════

  Over the past month `org-plot.el' has received some attention, my two
  favourite changes are:
  ⁃ You can now call `org-plot/gnuplot' with `C-c C-c' on a `#+plot'
    line _TEC_
  ⁃ When an image is regenerated, all instances of the image in the
    buffer are refreshed _TEC_

  Other than a few minor tweaks and bug fixes, that's it for
  April. However, over the last year there have been some rather nice
  improvements that I didn't mention in the initial blog post, so let's
  go over them now.

  ⁃ The inbuilt plot types have been abstracted out into a new
    structure: `org-plot/preset-plot-types'.  This means if you have a
    gnuplot template you find yourself using a lot, you can now turn it
    into a custom plot type 😀 _TEC_
  ⁃ A new plot type has been added: a radar / spider plot _TEC_
  ⁃ Some new plot keywords have arrived too _TEC_
    • `transpose' (`trans') — The plot internally does something very
          similar to `M-x org-table-transpose-table-at-point' before
          using the table data.
    • `ymin' (`min'), `ymax' (`max'), `xmin', `xmax' — Four new keywords
      (and two aliases) to set the bounds of a plot. Partially supported
      by the default types.
    • `ticks' — The number of axis ticks to use along the axis. A good
      value is guessed based on a prime factorisation based heuristic
      (welcome to improvements).
    • Some new customisation functions — The new variables
      `org-plot/gnuplot-script-preamble', `org-plot/gnuplot-term-extra',
      and `org-plot/gnuplot-script-preamble' open up new ways to tweak
      plots to your liking. For example, [I use this] to set line and
      background colours based on my current Emacs theme.

  If you haven't used Org plot before, I think it's a great way to
  quickly visualise data in a table. To get started, all you need is a
  `#+plot' line above the table, with a certain `type' specified
  (e.g. `type:2d' for a 2d line plot).  Then, if you can specify a
  certain columns as the independent variable (x-values) with `ind', and
  list dependant variables (y-values) with `deps'.

  You can see these parameters set in the figure above,
  ┌────
  │ #+plot: type:2d ind:1 deps:(2 3 4)
  │ | Xval | Red | Blue | Green |
  │ |------+-----+------+-------|
  │ |    0 |   1 |    2 |     3 |
  │ |    1 |   2 |    3 |     4 |
  └────

  This will call gnuplot and a window showing the plot will appear. If
  you want to save the plot to a file, just use the `file' parameter,
  e.g.  `file:"demoplot.svg"' (note the quotes).

  That should get you started, you can see [the manual] for the full
  list of available keywords and find more examples of usage [on worg].

Tweaked `ox-html' style
═══════════════════════

  As displays become more high-res, lines of text which span the whole
  screen become … long. So long that it genuinely makes it harder to
  read the text. A small tweak to the default style and lines are now
  capped at `60em' wide and centred in the page — much better 🙂. _TEC_

  Also, the HTML export now:
  ⁃ has a slightly nicer source block style
  ⁃ labels `authinfo' blocks


A collection of export improvements
═══════════════════════════════════

  ⁃ `Verbatim' in headings no longer breaks LaTeX exports _TEC_
  ⁃ Make the top level class for exported HTML customisable via
    `org-html-content-class' / `#+HTML_CONTENT_CLASS' _Sameer Rahmani_
  ⁃ Use `<img>' tags for SVGs with `ox-html', for better behaviour and
    W3C compliance _TEC_
  ⁃ Remove redundant `type="text/javascript"' from `<script>' elements
    _Bastien Guerry_
  ⁃ `ox-texinfo' now generates better headlines, menus, and footnotes
    _Nicolas Goaziou_
  ⁃ Parsing during exporting no longer aborts as soon as an `#+option'
    key without a value is encountered, instead that key is skipped over
    _Nicolas Goaziou_
  ⁃ `org-html-scripts' and `org-html-style-default' have been changed
    from constants to configurable values _TEC_
  ⁃ eval macros `#+macro: ? (eval ...)' are now a little bit faster
    _Stefan Monnier_


Miscellaneous changes
═════════════════════

  ⁃ `org-link-descriptive' is now buffer-local, to avoid interfering
    with other buffers _Kyle Meyer_
  ⁃ `org-colview' no longer chokes when a special property is updated
    _Nicolas Goaziou_
  ⁃ Now coderefs have their whitespace cleaned up during tangling _Tom
    Gillespie_
  ⁃ Allow for multiple `%(expressions)' in `org-agenda-prefix-format'
    _Ihor Radchenko_
  ⁃ Code cleanup and refactoring _Nicolas Savage, Aaron L. Zeng, Nicolas
    Goaziou, Bastien Guerry, Stefa Monnier, Arne Babenhauserheid_
  ⁃ Documentation improvements _Jorge Neto, Erik Hetzner, Cheong Yiu
    Fung, Kyle Meyer_
  ⁃ New `ob-sqlite' maintainer — Nick Savage
  ⁃ Make lilypond header arguments user-configurable _Jamie Bayne_
  ⁃ Fix `ob-C' regression which mixed up `int', `double', and
    `char*'. Fix another regression with table parameters _tbanel_
  ⁃ Fix indentation of list items and new logbook drawer notes _Bastien
    Guerry_
  ⁃ Notice when theme changes with LaTeX previews _Yuri Lensky_
  ⁃ Iron out a few edge cases in `ol.el' (Org links) _Nicolas Goaziou_
  ⁃ Some new tests for `org-protocol' _Maxim Nikulin_
