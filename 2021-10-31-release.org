Turns out that life became busy enough that instead of delaying, last month's
post had to be cancelled. We're now back to business as usual though ðŸ™‚.

There have been some cool recent developments in Org over the past two months,
but you'll have to learn about those is next month's edition as /Org 9.5 has been
released/ ðŸŽ‰. So, let's go over some of the changes I'm most excited about, in no
particular order. To get a more complete picture of the latest changes, see
[[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/org-mode.git/tree/etc/ORG-NEWS?h=release_9.5#n14][ORG-NEWS]].
* The new citation engine

As tempted as I am to wax lyrical about the lovely new citation engine, I've
already dedicated [[file:2021-07-31-citations.org][July's post]] to it, and so will simply highlight how versatile
the syntax is. Combined with the ability to swap out the default backends
(basic, CSL, natbib, and bib(la)tex) for a 3rd party backend (for example,
provided by a package) it is capable of meeting your citation and technical
document publishing needs, whatever they may be.

Since the announcement of org-cite, the ecosystem has continued to expand with a
number of promising packages like Bruce D'Arcus' [[https://github.com/bdarcus/citar][citar]] (previously
/bibtex-actions/), which currently provides what is arguably the best citation
insertion experience.

* Asynchronous session evaluation

Since being featured in [[file:2021-05-31-async.org][May's post]], we've had the initial python support
expanded with support for R too. I have good reason to believe that more
backends will join this list in the future.

To get started, just add =:async= to the header arguments of Python or R source
blocks with a =:session=.
* LaTeX environment =#+results= are now removed

LaTeX environments (i.e. src_LaTeX{\begin{} ... \end{}} blocks) have been added
to the list of =#+results= types that will be removed. This is bigger news than
one might think, as it means that raw LaTeX environments are now a viable output
for org-babel backends. This possesses a distinct advantage over =:results latex=
as LaTeX environments can be rendered inline with ~org-latex-preview~ and are
exported to more formats --- for example HTML with MathJax.

This is likely going to be first seen in the new =ob-julia= backend (unreleased,
currently in early development), but could well be utilised by other backends
such as =ob-octave=, =ob-mathematica= (in contrib), =ob-python= (using ~SymPy~), =ob-calc=
and more.

* More fontification

A number of new faces have been introduced to allow for improved theming
capability, and better contextual hints in the agenda, namely:
~org-agenda-date-weekend-today~, ~org-imminent-deadline~,
~org-agenda-structure-secondary~, and ~org-agenda-structure-filter~.

Inline export snippets are now also fontified using the ~org-tag~ and
~font-lock-comment-face~ faces, to better stand out from surrounding text.
* More link formatting options with org-capture

A new formatting directive, ~%L~ has been introduced which provides the bare link
target. This allows for links with automatically generated descriptions ðŸ™‚.
* Export improvements

The HTML and LaTeX backends have both been given some love in this release of
Org.

The HTML backend now supports customisation of the =<meta>= tags included with
~org-html-meta-tags~, which should be particularly useful to anybody using
=org-publish= for blogs or websites (in fact, this blog has been making use of it
for some time now). A new variable has been introduced to help with styling,
~org-html-content-class~ (="content"= by default) which is used as the CSS class for
the top-level content wrapper. To further improve styling capabilities,
~org-html-style-default~ and ~org-html-scripts~ have been changed from constants to
customisable variables.

The LaTeX backend (=ox-latex=) no longer has obsolete LaTeX packages in
~org-latex-default-packages-alist~ (=grffile= and =texcomp= have been removed).
It also now supports arbitrary =:float= argument values, and accepts a six new
arguments (in total) for verse (=:lines=, =:center=, =:versewidth=, and =:latexcode=)
and quote blocks (=:environment= and =:options=).
* Project changes

To reduce the maintainer burden, the =contrib/= folder and a collection of
rarely-used or barely-maintained =ob-*= backends have been moved to a new repo,
[[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-contrib][org-contrib]]. Support for Emacs 24 (2012--2014) has also been dropped, and Org
will now aim to support the three most recent major versions of Emacs.
