With a 9.5 release highlight post last month, and the month before skipped, it's
now /three months/ since the last regular instalment of TMIO. Let's get back up
to date on some of the latest happenings with Org.

* Org as markup

Looking at the wider ecosystem, it certainly appears that there is a growing
appetite for Org markup outside org-mode. More projects like [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] and [[https://logseq.com/][Logseq]]
seem to be interested in supporting Org markup, and there has been a recent
growth in editor extensions like Neovim's [[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/][orgmode.nvim]] (started in March this
year) and Sublime Text's [[https://packagecontrol.io/packages/OrgExtended][OrgExtended]] (started in June this year).

Interest in Org as a general-usage markup format can also be seen within the Org
project. Primarily lead by Nicolas Goaziou, there is an ongoing attempt to
codify the Org syntax in a formal specification in the Worg document [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][Org Syntax
(draft)]]. Other members of the Org mailing list have directed their effort to
creating non-elisp parsers for Org, both to help Org tools be created in other
languages, and as put in the README for Tom Gillespie's [[https://github.com/tgbugs/laundry][laundry]] parser
#+begin_quote
The long term goal of this work is to provide a reference that can be used to
standardize Org syntax and behavior and to specify various levels of compliance
for an implementation of Org mode.
#+end_quote

Earlier this week Karl Voit, the author of the rather well-known document [[https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/][Org
Mode Is One of the Most Reasonable Markup Languages to Use for Text]], surprised
the mailing list by announcing his independent creation of a multi-leveled
standard for Org syntax subsets called "Orgdown" (the name is a blend of
"Org-mode" and "markdown", but the standard is only a subset of Org). Each level
defines a compliance score given by a mix of parsing and editing support, with
example compliance scores for the first (and currently only) level of the
standard given for common tools.

At this stage, it isn't clear exactly how the Org-outside-Emacs landscape will
evolve, but the swelling interest is very encouraging.

* An Org parser in Julia

Speaking of parsers, I may be somewhat biased but I'm quite happy that a Org
parser for [[https://julialang.org/][Julia]] now exists ðŸŽ‰.

[[Https://github.com/tecosaur/OrgMode.jl]]

OrgMode.jl is a parser, but also intended as a general-purpose Org library for
Julia. It's only been a week since development started, but it currently
supports most of the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][Org Syntax]] draft specification, along with the rendering of
a parsed Org AST to a TTY or back to Org text. A few utility functions are also
included, such as ~filtermap~ which operates similarly to ~org-element-map~.

* Autoloading citation backends

One small but impactful change is autoloading of citation backends. Until
recently before say using the =csl= backend, one needed to
src_elisp{(require 'oc-csl)} or face error messages.

Now, if you have a line like:
#+begin_example
#+cite_export: FORMAT ...
#+end_example
org-mode will try to load the file =oc-FORMAT= before trying to process citations.

This should make getting started with citations in Org just a bit easier.

* A nicer =:tangle-mode= syntax

The standard way of setting a =:tangle-mode= has typically been by providing a
closure that makes use of Elisp's octal syntax, such as =(identity #o755)=. This
is unnecessarily verbose, and certainly doesn't feel natural.

With the addition of a small mode-interpreting function
(~org-babel-interpret-file-mode~) It is now possible to specify =:tangle-mode= using
three different forms of shorthand
+ octal :: =o755= is equivalent to =(identity #o755)=
+ chmod :: ~chmod~-style inputs like =u+x= are now parsed to a file mode[fn:1] with the
  the base/default mode set by ~org-babel-tangle-default-file-mode~.
+ ls -l :: strings of the form given by ~ls -l~ like =rwxr-xr-x= are also accepted

This means the following forms are now all equivalent:
#+begin_example
:tangle-mode (identity #o755)
:tangle-mode o755
:tangle-mode a=rx,u+w
:tangle-mode rwxr-xr-x
#+end_example

It has also been noted on the mailing list that the =:tangle-mode (identity
#o755)= form works by being transformed to =:tangle-mode 493= during parsing.
Similarly =:tangle-mode 755= is equivalent to =:tangle-mode (identity #o1363)=. For
some values the decimal and octal interpretation are /both/ valid file modes. Due
to the clear potential for confusion, and since file permissions are an
important security consideration, it has been suggested on the mailing list that
these forms should be depreciated with a warning in future. No decision has been
made yet though.

* Org element parser cache

Ihor Radchenko has done some fantastic work over the past few months by
overhauling parts of =org-element.el= to introduce extensive caching. =org-element=
is /the/ Org markup parser inside org-mode. This allows for a huge jump in speed,
and also provides a few functions which fetch information without updating the
cache --- allowing for particularly speedy lookups with a small sacrifice to
correctness guarantees on one or two properties in particular cases.

Several org-mode APIs now make use of the cache to dramatically improve speed.
Aside from improvements to typically slow operations, this is ideal for
situations involving frequent buffer edits.
It's no understatement to say that this work is transformative.

One potential beneficiary from this work is actually fontification. It has
become increasingly apparent that the current regex-based method for buffer
fontification is imperfect, and can actually differ from the true structure of
the document as parsed (authoritatively) by =org-element=. This has lead to the
well-received suggestion on the mailing list to rewrite the fontification code
to be built on =org-element= instead.

* Inline source block fontification

I think [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-of-Code-Blocks.html][inline source code blocks]] are an underappreciated feature of Org. I
don't think it's helped that they have not been visually treated at all
differently from plain text. Now though, they have a new dedicated face
(~org-inline-src-block~) /and/ in the same manner as source blocks, based on
~org-src-fontify-natively~ can be fontified using the language's major mode.

#+caption: and inline source blocks (~src_~).
#+attr_html: :class doom-one
 [[file:figures/inline-src-block-fontified-vs-code.png]]

If you aren't familiar with inline source blocks, you're missing out. They are
very much the inline cousin of source blocks, and so support all your favourite
Babel features like code execution and header arguments. This provides a
fantastic capacity to inline dynamically computed expressions, and optionally
show the code that produces them.

#+caption: org-mode patch).

* Functions as default heading arguments

Matt Huszagh has contributed a patch that allows functions to be used as values
for default header arguments. This is great for arguments where a sensible
default can be provided by evaluating a function on-the-fly.

Consider for example the arguments required to produce a simple image using R
with Babel:
#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file myimage.svg
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + geom_point()
,#+end_src
#+end_src

In a Jupyter-style (=.ipynb=) or throwaway document, we likely don't care about
the file name at all. With these new capabilities, we can provide a file name
dynamically as a default argument!

First we must write a function that when run at the source block will give us a
suitable file name, like so

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/org-src-sha-to-image ()
  (concat "generated-"
          (substring
           (sha1 (org-element-property :value (org-element-at-point)))
           0 8)
          ".svg"))
#+end_src

Let's also write a function to guess whether the source block produces a plot by
checking if there's a plot command on the last line.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/org-src-guess-results-type ()
  (if (string-match-p "^ *\\(?:plot\\|ggplot\\)([^\n]+\n?\\'"
                      (org-element-property :value (org-element-at-point)))
      "graphics file" "replace"))
#+end_src

Then we can just use these function in place of a static value in the default
header arguments variable --- that's all it takes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-default-header-args:R
      '((:results . my/org-src-guess-results-type)
        (:file . my/org-src-sha-to-image)))
#+end_src

This means for most cases we can now get away without any header arguments at all.

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src R
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + geom_point()
,#+end_src
#+end_src

It's always lovely to see more ways of reducing boilerplate.

* Proportional image widths

Previously, as long as ~org-image-actual-width~ was ~nil~ or a list of the form
~(default-value)~, =org-mode= would display images according to a =:width= attribute
(e.g. =#+attr_html: :width 400px=) by simply looking for the first =#+attr_=
affiliated keyword and reading the numeric component of the =:width= as the number
of pixels wide the image should be.

This has now become somewhat fancier. The image-width determining logic has been
extracted to a new function (~org-display-inline-image--width~) which will now
extract floating-point values like =0.7= and interpret them as that portion of the
accessible text width in the buffer.

#+caption: A containing with an image set to half of the accesible text width
#+attr_html: :class doom-one
[[file:figures/proportional-image-width.png]]

This means that a width parameter like =#+attr_latex: :width 0.7\linewidth= the
image will displayed as 70% of the buffer text width.
This also supports percentage value, like =#+attr_html: :width 80%= by dividing
the number before the =%= by 100 as a floating-point value.
As always, if you don't like the way display width is inferred here you can
override it by putting a =#+attr_org: :width X= statement first.

Support for proportional image widths extends to the ~(default-value)~ form of
~org-image-actual-width~, as now if you set it to say ~(0.9)~ which will cause
images /without/ any width specification to be displayed at 90% of the buffer text
width.

If you want to have some images displayed as their actual width you can use the
new special width parameter =t= to set this on a per-image basis with =#+attr_org:
:width t=. Now all you need to do is remember to put this first. Based on current
discussions on the mailing list though, soon =#+attr_org= will be prioritised when
determining display image width, no matter which order you put the attributes
in. I do like having one less thing to remember ðŸ™‚.

[fn:1] This is performed easily thanks to ~file-modes-symbolic-to-number~, which
is used as the basis for both the ~chmod~ and ~ls -l~ shorthand interpretations.
