* Introduction

Org is an absolutely marvellous project. However, a quick glance at
https://orgmode.org can lead one to think "so... it's an Emacs version of
Markdown? What's the big deal?". While it's easy to understand how someone might
think that at first, that impression misses two crucial points:
+ While for simple constructs (*bold*, /italic/, headlines, etc.) the syntax is very
  much analogous[fn:1], Org scales to much more powerful forms that are a
  headache to replicate in Markdown
+ Org mode was developed in Emacs, for Emacs. The integrations for Org put /every
  other plaintext markup editing experience to shame/. *This is a bold statement*,
  and I stand by it.

This blog exists because of the second point. The world does not stand still,
while new Markdown editors et al. are [[https://github.com/marktext/marktext][popping]] [[https://github.com/ApostropheEditor/Apostrophe][up]] [[https://remarkableapp.github.io/linux.html][left]], [[https://github.com/brrd/Abricotine][right]], [[https://github.com/DaveJarvis/keenwrite][and]] [[https://znote.io/][centre]] --- Org
has not languished. The [[https://orgmode.org/list/][mailing list]] is active, as is development, and the
number of things you can do with Org is only increasing.

However, if one doesn't want to receive tens to hundreds of emails a week, it
can be all too easy to miss out on exciting developments[fn:3] ðŸ˜¢. So, to help keep
you abreast of the latest in Org, I'm starting a blog âœ¨. Like all good things,
it is [[https://github.com/tecosaur/this-month-in-org/][written entirely in Org]].

Inspired by [[https://pointieststick.com/category/this-week-in-kde/][This Week in KDE]] I'm thrilled to announce /This Month in Org/ (we have
slightly less going on than a Desktop Environment[fn:2]). Each month I shall
endeavour to present the highlights of Org development.

Who knows, perhaps you might see something you'd like to help out with or
suggest improvements too. We'd love you to [[https://orgmode.org/community.html][get in touch]].

* Catching up on lost time --- a year in review

I joined the Org mailing list in May last year, it's almost been a year since
then and we've seen the release of Org 9.4, and its inclusion in Emacs 27.

I'm not going to do 12 months of work for just this one post, but I'd like to
give you a sample of what's changed over the last year.

** A new discussion tracker --- [[https://updates.orgmode.org/][updates.orgmode.org]]

Mid last year Bastien rolled out tracker for
+ Upcoming changes
+ Help requests
+ Bugs
+ Patches

This should help ensure nothing slips through the cracks of the ML.

[[file:figures/screenshot-of-updates-orgmode-org.png]]

It's very slick, and Bastien built a [[https://github.com/bzg/woof][mailbox monitor]] just for it --- so be sure
to check it out. This should make it easier to see what needs doing. If you feel
inclined to help out with Org check out the /Help requests/ section in particular.

You can also get RSS feeds for individual sections, or get the information as
JSON to work into your own projects, for example [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html#development][an elisp function to fetch and
apply patches]].

** Inline display of remote images

Ever gazed forlornly at a link like
=[[https://github.com/larsmagne/meme/raw/master/images/Grandma-Finds-The-Internet.jpg]]=
wishing you could see the image?

Wish no more! Thanks to Jack Kamm you can now look upon remote images in all
their glory!

#+caption: Org mode discovers the internet
#+attr_html: :style height:16em
#+attr_latex: :width 0.4\linewidth
[[https://github.com/larsmagne/meme/raw/master/images/Grandma-Finds-The-Internet.jpg]]

To get this working, simply set src_elisp{org-display-remote-inline-images} to
src_elisp{'download} or src_elisp{'cache}.

** Use ~org-edit-special~ (=C-c '=) with LaTeX fragments

It's great how in Org you can jump into a LaTeX-mode minibuffer for LaTeX
environments, but why leave inline LaTeX fragments out? We'll, they're now in.

** Control heading display on startup

=org-num-mode= is great for when you're keeping an eye on section numbers, but
it's not fun to find yourself enabling it every time you open a file where you
want it. With the new option =#+startup: num= by Bastien, you can set and forget
at last.

#+caption: Opening a buffer with the new =num= and =show2levels= startup options
#+attr_html: :class invertible
[[file:figures/org-startup-num-and-levels.png]]

Should you want to set the number of levels you see on opening a file, there's
now an option for that too. Gustav WikstrÃ¶m has added /another/ new option
=#+startup: show<n>levels= (where =<n>= is between 2 and 5, inclusive).
/NB: This is part of the upcoming 9.5 release/

** Set permissions of tangled files

Are you particular about your file permissions? If so you'll likely like John
Herrlin's new source block header argument =:file-mode= pertinent. The easiest way
to set a permission is with an [[https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/unix-file-permissions/][octal value]], like so:
#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src shell :results file :file script.sh :file-mode (identity #o755)
echo "#!/bin/bash"
echo "echo Hello World"
,#+end_src
#+end_src

** A collection of improvements to source block header arguments

These's been a whole set of these, so I'll just list them off.
+ python, improved =:return=  :: Now works with sessions and the =:epilogue=
  argument (Jack Kamm)
+ Java, new argument =:cmdargs= :: Add some command line arguments to be passed to
  ~java~ (Jarmo Hurri)
+ C/C++, non-system headers with =:includes= :: values that don't start with =<=
  will now be formatted as double-quoted src_C{#include} statements (Brandon
  Guttersohn)
+ Screen, new argument =:screenrc= :: For those of you who still haven't moved to
  =tmux= (Kenneth D. Mankoff)

** A seven year old bug was fixed

In 2013 [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2013-08/msg00072.html][it was reported]] that an infinite loop could be triggered in
~org-agenda-show-new-time~. At long last, this has been fixed by Bastien.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Aside from somewhat more [[https://orgmode.org/quickstart.html][intuitive syntax]] for emphasis and simple
structures, Org also has the advantage of not having [[https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/markdown-flavors][40 functionally distinct
specifications]]. There is only one Org. \\
NB: If you attempt to be pendantic you may say that there are multiple Orgs
because, for example, GitHub uses [[https://github.com/wallyqs/org-ruby][org-ruby]]. However, that's just an incomplete
implementation --- not a [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][specification]].

[fn:2] That said, with /interesting/ projects like the [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework][Emacs Application
Framework]] and the [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][Emacs X Window Manager]], one could argue that Org is
(sometimes) a major component of a desktop environment...

[fn:3] There is [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/src/master/etc/ORG-NEWS][ORG-NEWS]], but do you /really/ check that? Besides, it doesn't even
have pictures.
