In [[file:2021-07-31-citations.org][July 2021]] I was thrilled to announce the long-awaited feature of citation
syntax. Today I get to announce a feature a bit closer to my heart, a dramatic
improvement (actually a complete overhaul of) Org's system for generating LaTeX
previews!

In late 2021, Karthik and I embarked on a project to improve the status quo by
ripping out the entire LaTeX preview implementation, and then building something
better in its place. After hundreds of hours (each), and just over a year, I
think it's fair to say we've succeeded.
* The Status Quo
* Major features of the overhaul

* Making the most of the new library

* The broad strokes of the implementation
