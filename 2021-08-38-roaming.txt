      Dear readers, unfortunately I’ve been unusually busy as of
      late, and will continue to be for a bit over a month. As
      such, it’s entirely likely that the next post or two may +be
      late+ make use of creative dates too.

In terms of Org development, we’ve had a fairly slow month — mostly
tweaks and fixes, concentrated on the new org-cite functionality.
However, there have been big developments with Roam as of late.


[Org-roam v2]
═════════════

  Pushed to the sidelines by last month’s hugely significant citations
  announcement was the release of Org-roam v2 🎉. The project’s author
  Jethro wrote a nice [blog post] outlining the major changes and
  motivations, and so I’ll leave him to speak on that. Suffice to say,
  the idea of org-roam has been refined into a form that should better
  server tinkerers looking to build off Org roam, and make maintenance
  easier — thus improving the user experience in the long term 🙂.
  Should you be worried that the v1 -> v2 upgrade will be painful, read
  [Org-roam v2 doesn’t hurt], relax, and try the upgrade wizard.

[Org-roam-ui]
═════════════

  Within a month of Roam v2’s announcement, we were pleasantly surprised
  by the release of [org-roam-server] usurper — org-roam-ui.

  While org-roam-server remains incompatible with Roam v2, org-roam-ui
  is built around v2 from the ground up. With this shift comes a much
  more ambitious set of features. The graph view itself is now based on
  [react-force-graph], which allows for both 2D and 3D views of the
  graph, with WebGL acceleration.

  Using [emacs-websocket], org-roam-ui establishes a two-way connection
  between Emacs and the Web visualisation. This allows for nifty
  features like syncing the graph view and the currently open roam file
  in Emacs. Furthermore, with `xwidget-webkit' you can even embed
  org-roam-ui /inside/ Emacs![1]

  Beyond this, org-roam-ui also provides a number of other nice
  features, such as filtering and theme syncing, with more in the works.
  To see more, check out the `README' published on GitHub.

New ConTeXt exporter
════════════════════

  We’ve long been able to export to LaTeX files with `ox-latex', but now
  you can export to ConTeXt too with [ox-context]! While only just
  released, a lot of work has already gone into this — with development
  starting almost a year ago by the commit history.

  //github.com/Jason-S-Ross/ox-context

  It’s always nice to see more export options for Org, and I wish Jason
  all the best in developing `ox-context'.

Footnotes
─────────

[1] I have found the `xwidget-webkit' experience quite unstable until
I started using Emacs 28 with the pure-GTK branch. So, if you’re not
getting a good experience now, there’s a good chance you’ll have a
better experience in the future.
