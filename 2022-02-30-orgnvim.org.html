Timothy (TEC) here. This month we have a guest post from a different part of the
Org ecosystem, to highlight one of the most promising efforts to provide a good
experience outside Emacs.

<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[Https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode]]</span>

"But I use Emacs, I don't care" you may say. In that case, I'd like to point out
that wider spread and better Org support enriches the Org ecosystem as a whole.
It makes the format more approachable, and <span class="ef-i">/useful/</span> for other people. This is good
for everybody.

Without any further ado, here's the guest post kindly written by Kristijan.
Enjoy!

-----

Like every beginner Vim user, at some point I ran into a usual editor war post:
Vim vs Emacs. At that time, I didn't have an idea what "Emacs" was.

A simple Google search yielded something that seemed just like a very simple
editor with strange, but more familiar shortcuts. I didn't bother too much to
figure out what it is, because I was already pulled in fairly deep into Vim and
its philosophy.

<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: nil; font-size: 1.25em">* Note taking in (Neo)Vim</span>

At first, I did some note taking only when really necessary, in random
plain text files. Most of the things I managed to keep in my head, since
I was younger and less busy ðŸ™‚.

Once I got into the situation where I needed to keep more notes, <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki][vimwiki]]</span> was the
natural choice.

That worked very well for a period, until the need for writing quick notes
arise. Vimwiki didn't have anything that would allow that. I could of course
have a mapping that opens a specific file where I can add notes, but that just
never felt right in my mind. I would keep a bunch of things in the same place,
and then later I needed to spend some time organizing them.

At that point, I wasn't sure how to achieve what I want. I did a brief look at
<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://orgmode.org/][Emacs OrgMode]]</span> to see what's all the fuss about, but to me, it seemed just like a
different version of Markdown. You put some unordered lists as your notes, and
that's it. I never spent more time trying to see all the neat features. I even
tried creating some of my custom note taking tools, but I never managed to
finish them because I didn't have a clear idea of how to solve my problems.

<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: nil; font-size: 1.25em">* First encounter with Orgmode like tool: vim-dotoo</span>

One weekend, I was browsing through Vim subreddit, as I usually do at least once
a day. There was a post about an "Orgmode like task logging" plugin called
<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-dotoo][vim-dotoo]]</span>. I opened it up, and I didn't see much at that point. I wasn't too
excited. I went through readme, and noticed that author (<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/dhruvasagar][dhruvasagar]]</span>) put a
fairly big emphasis on the "Agenda view". I had no idea what "Agenda view" is.
Thankfully, the author also made a <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsv33iOnH34][screencast]]</span>, which is rather long (1.5h), but
I had some time, so I went through it.

At that point, I was first met with "Capturing" and "Refiling". <span class="ef-b">*My mind was
blown!*</span> What a simple, yet extremely powerful idea! How had that never crossed my
mind? From that point on, this plugin had my full attention.

I'm always emphasizing that <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/dhruvasagar][dhruvasagar]]</span> and his <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-dotoo][vim-dotoo]]</span> plugin are most
deserving for having inspired <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode]]</span>, and I
can't thank him enough for that.

<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: nil; font-size: 1.25em">* First steps with vim-dotoo and birth of orgmode.nvim</span>

For some time, I was using <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-dotoo][vim-dotoo]]</span>. I moved all of my Vimwiki notes to it. It
was a breath of fresh air. Alongside that, I started getting more interest in
the original Emacs Orgmode. I started noticing the differences, and some of the
missing features that were now looking quite attractive. I made <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-dotoo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Akristijanhusak+is%3Aclosed][few
contributions]]</span> to vim-dotoo. As time passed, and my notes started to grow, things
began being slow. I did some profiling, and figured out that it's just a usual
Vim problem, Vimscript performance. It was just too slow for certain things that
Orgmode provides, and it would hardly get any better as more things are added.

Separately from Vim and Vimscript, <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/neovim/neovim][Neovim]]</span> was on a stable <span style="color: #9e9e9e;">=v0.4=</span> release, and <span style="color: #9e9e9e;">=v0.5=</span>
was still being developed. I was using Neovim from version 0.3, and was
carefully following the progress on it. Lua was introduced as a first class
citizen. A Bunch of new plugins arise from it. All the benchmarks showed that
Lua outperforms Vimscript in almost everything. Besides the performance, Lua is
a "normal" programming language, which means that support for it is much better.

At that point, I became curious: Could Lua be the path to the faster Orgmode? I
spent several days thinking about it. I wanted to give it a try. My biggest
concern was that I had absolutely zero experience writing parsers. I had never
written anything more complicated than an averagely complicated regex for
purposes of parsing. I noticed that vim-dotoo also used regex to do the parsing,
so that eased my mind a bit.

One weekend, I started working on it. It was really interesting and challenging.
I spent a lot of my free time on it. At certain points, it seemed like hacking,
since it was not a proper parsing. I tried to learn how to write a proper
parser, but it was just too time consuming and complicated. I proceeded with the
regex parsing to see how far I can go.

Besides parsing, I had a few more challenges to overcome:

<span style="color: #97365b; font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.15em">** Understanding the OrgMode syntax and all the functionality</span>

This is still the biggest challenge. I didn't have any idea how big and robust
OrgMode is. If I would know it at that time, I wouldn't even jump on this train.
It's really hard to grasp all of it. Considering I've only used it for around 8
months, I think I made some good progress on learning it.

<span style="color: #97365b; font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.15em">** Remote editing</span>

By remote editing, I mean automatically updating content in the current
or any other file. Few examples: adding/updating properties, managing
tags, changing TODO states, archiving, refiling, remote editing from
agenda view, etc.

There is no built-in way to update content in another file through the
Neovim API, without actually opening the file in an editor. I solved
this by:

- Saving as much position information as possible in the internal state,
  so I can pinpoint the correct location
- Opening a file in a <span style="color: #9e9e9e;">=1 row x 1 col=</span> floating window and doing quick
  edits there

<span style="color: #97365b; font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.15em">** Working with dates</span>

From my experience, dates are challenging in all areas of programming,
so this is not so surprising. There are some Lua plugins for dates, but
those seemed a bit too basic for my use case, and I wanted to keep
external plugins to the minimum. I went with a custom solution that uses
Lua's native dates, which has certain limitations, but works out for
most of the things.

<span style="color: #97365b; font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.15em">** Highlighting, mostly in Agenda view</span>

Vim's syntax engine is fairly old, but still very much used, especially
in the Vim community. Implementation of tree-sitter slightly improved
this experience in Neovim, because "Highlight matches" are found via
tree-sitter, instead of a bunch of regexes.

This helped me out later for the Org file itself, but agenda view is
still something that's built as a custom view. Old Syntax highlight engine
would be really hard to add, because the content is too dynamic. I went
with the Neovim highlight API that allows Highlighting things by their
exact position in the buffer. Tree-sitter implementation does something
similar in the background for Highlighting.

<span style="color: #97365b; font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.15em">** Keeping configuration simple and familiar to Emacs OrgMode</span>

Vim-dotoo configuration was mostly Vim style, through some global
variables. I wanted to have a configuration that is familiar to an Emacs
OrgMode user, by having as many options as possible named completely the
same as in Emacs.

For example, Here's a comparison of few options between Emacs and
Neovim:

Emacs:

<span class="ef-obb">#+begin_src elisp
</span><span class="ef-ob">(</span><span style="color: #3b6ea8; background-color: #e0e0e0;">setq</span><span class="ef-ob"> org-agenda-files '(</span><span style="color: #4f894c; background-color: #e0e0e0;">"~/orgmodes"</span><span class="ef-ob">))
(</span><span style="color: #3b6ea8; background-color: #e0e0e0;">setq</span><span class="ef-ob"> org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t)
(</span><span style="color: #3b6ea8; background-color: #e0e0e0;">setq</span><span class="ef-ob"> org-agenda-span 7)
(</span><span style="color: #3b6ea8; background-color: #e0e0e0;">setq</span><span class="ef-ob"> org-hide-leading-stars t)
 (</span><span style="color: #3b6ea8; background-color: #e0e0e0;">setq</span><span class="ef-ob"> org-capture-templates
       '((</span><span style="color: #4f894c; background-color: #e0e0e0;">"t"</span> <span style="color: #4f894c; background-color: #e0e0e0;">"Todo"</span><span class="ef-ob"> entry (file </span><span style="color: #4f894c; background-color: #e0e0e0;">"~/orgmodes/todos.org"</span><span class="ef-ob">)
      </span><span style="color: #4f894c; background-color: #e0e0e0;">"* TODO %?"</span><span class="ef-ob">)
     (</span><span style="color: #4f894c; background-color: #e0e0e0;">"j"</span> <span style="color: #4f894c; background-color: #e0e0e0;">"Journal"</span><span class="ef-ob"> entry (file </span><span style="color: #4f894c; background-color: #e0e0e0;">"~/orgmodes/journal.org"</span><span class="ef-ob">)
      </span><span style="color: #4f894c; background-color: #e0e0e0;">"* %?\nEntered on %U\n   %a"</span><span class="ef-ob">)))
</span><span class="ef-obe">#+end_src
</span>
Neovim:

<span class="ef-obb">#+begin_src lua
</span><span class="ef-ob">require('orgmode').setup({
   org_agenda_files = { '~/orgmodes' },
   org_agenda_skip_scheduled_if_done = true,
   org_agenda_span = 7,
   org_hide_leading_stars = true
   org_capture_templates = {
      t = {
     description = 'Todo',
     target = '~/orgmodes/todos.org',
     template = '* TODO %?',
      },
      j = {
     description = 'Journal',
     target = '~/orgmodes/journal.org',
     template = '* %?\nEntered on %U\n   %a',
      }
   }
})
</span><span class="ef-obe">#+end_src
</span>
One of the most noticeable differences is between the usage of hyphens
(<span style="color: #9e9e9e;">=-</span><span style="color: #9e9e9e;">=</span><span style="color: #9e9e9e;">) and underscores (</span><span style="color: #9e9e9e;">=_=</span>). I did that only for the sake of simplicity,
because hyphens is not a valid character in variable names in Lua, so
all of the options would need to be wrapped as a string (for example:
<span style="color: #9e9e9e;">=['org-agenda-files']=</span>).

<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: nil; font-size: 1.25em">* First release of orgmode.nvim and introduction of tree-sitter parser</span>

After ~1.5 months I <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/o8zp0k/orgmodenvim_orgmode_clone_written_in_lua_for/][published the initial version]]</span>. The focus was on Agenda and
capturing (GTD), since those are the things I mostly used. It got some traction,
and people started testing it and reporting bugs.

One of the common questions was: <span class="ef-i">/"Any plans to introduce tree-sitter parser?"/</span>.

I knew about <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter][tree-sitter]]</span> and used it in my day-to-day job for a few programming
languages, but I had absolutely no idea how it worked, and especially how to
write a tree-sitter parser. I put it aside, and continued working on what I
had.

One day, Emilia (<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/milisims][milisims]]</span>) contacted me via email to ask me if I would be
willing to try the tree-sitter parser she's been working on for some time. I
gladly accepted. She gave me access to the repository, and I started tinkering
with it in a separate branch. No one was aware at that point that tree-sitter
support would happen some time soon.

After some time, I set up a "beta" branch called "tree-sitter" and <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/ph2xqc/orgmodenvim_treesitter_support/][announced it
for testing]]</span>. Once the reported bugs slowed to a trickle, I merged it into the
"master" branch.

I believe that tree-sitter grammar for Org could help out other editors to
implement their version of Orgmode plugin, but I don't think it would ever be
helpful for Emacs. Emacs parser is the one and only that has it all implemented.
Also, as much as tree-sitter is powerful, its main purpose is to parse
programming languages, which mostly has "static" patterns to match. Orgmode is
by its nature dynamic, which causes a variety of issues for a parser that's not
meant for that kind of usage.

<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: nil; font-size: 1.25em">* Limitations</span>

(Neo)Vim is a great editor, but it still cannot compare to Emacs in certain
things. Manipulating the "View" part of the editor is tricky or impossible for
certain things.

I even <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Aneovim-dependency][made a label]]</span> for reported issues where Neovim support for certain things
is a blocker. I'm hoping that at least some of these will be available in future
Neovim releases.

<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: nil; font-size: 1.25em">* Features</span>

I will not go into too many details about the available features, since those
can be viewed in <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode#features-detailed-breakdown][repository readme]]</span>, but I want to mention one feature that does
not exist as a built/-in feature in the Emacs Orgmode: <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/blob/master/DOCS.md#notifications-experimental][Notifications]]</span>.

This allows getting a "desktop notification" for tasks that are within
the specified threshold for schedule/deadline time. It requires some
configuration to set up a cron job, but it's been working great for me
for several months now.

<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: nil; font-size: 1.25em">* Plans</span>

The current state of the project is very usable for me. I'm not lacking any of
the major features, mostly because I'm not used to using them. Nevertheless,
there are plans to add more things, and I'm getting a lot of help from the
community. I want to specifically mention <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/levouh][levouh]]</span> and <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/lukas-reineke][lukas-reineke]]</span>, since they
added a lot of value to the project, and I want to thank them and everyone else
who contributed. Their help is much appreciated.

There are few high priority tasks that I'm hoping to flush out first:

- Implementing <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/milisims/tree-sitter-org/issues/13][v1.0.0]]</span> release of the tree-sitter parser. This should allow for
  faster and less error-prone parsing.
- <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/issues/26][Infrastructure for plugin developers]]</span>, to allow other people to build plugins
  on top of nvim-orgmode.

And a long term goal for these:

- Tables support (and at least basic formulas)
- <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/issues/190][Org Babel like code block evaluation]]</span> (and hopefully basic support for literate
  programming)
- <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/issues/195][Diary format dates]]</span>
- <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/issues/135][Custom agenda commands]]</span>
- More clocking features (reports)
- File specific configuration via directives (<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/issues/185][todo keywords]]</span>, properties, etc.)

<span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: nil; font-size: 1.25em">* Closing thoughts</span>

When I started working on <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode][nvim-orgmode]]</span>, I didn't have a clue what I'm jumping
into. Every day I learn about more and more Orgmode features that I wasn't even
aware existed.

I'm certain that this project will never manage to clone the Orgmode
functionality completely, but I'm hoping it will get close enough so everyone
from Neovim community and Emacsers trying out Neovim will be able to use it for
their needs.

Having experienced Orgmode users <span style="color: #3b6ea8; font-weight: 700;">[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/issues/159][testing]]</span> it is a huge help, so if anyone is
willing to give it a try, feel free to open up an issue and write your thoughts
there. Thanks!
