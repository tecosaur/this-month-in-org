Just over eight months ago, I kicked off /This Month in Org/ with an
emphatic announcement of the blog’s in the form of a [Welcome] post. If
you haven’t guessed, this is the first “blog post” I’ve ever written. In
that /welcome/ post, I gave my motivation for starting the blog —
essentially to bridge a perceived gap in information sources between a
subscription to the Org project mailing list, and nothing.

That is why I thought this blog should exist, but until now I have
neglected to mention what /I/ want to accomplish with it. By starting
/TMiO/ I hoped to:
⁃ Engage more people with the improvements being made to Org[1].
⁃ Highlight some of the great work being done by Org[1] contributors.
⁃ Encourage more people to consider contributing to Org[1].
⁃ Foster a stronger sense of an Org[1] community, outside the mailing
  list.

Since then, I’ve effused about Org to the tune of around ten thousand
words. We started off with a fairly dry recount recent changes, which
(after initial feedback) has shifted slightly to try to give more
context on the improvements and how they may be used. In June I even
went as far as to make the majority of the post about pre-existing
features (writing Org for LaTeX). This change has been made to:
⁃ Try to make the blog posts a little more interesting, and less
  tedious.
⁃ Potentially introduce readers to nice features of Org they weren’t
  aware of before.

We have now arrived at the first crucial question of this post: /How
effective has this blog been in achieving its goals?/

Let’s start off by looking at engagement. There is no tracking on this
site, and I’m not even counting page views. We could read into Reddit
upvotes (which usually hover around 100-ish per post), but with no
strong trend I’m wary of reading too much into those numbers. What about
engendering an interest in contributing? This is even harder to
consider. It is similarly difficult to judge whether this blog might be
helping (even if only a bit) foster a stronger sense of community.

Ok, how about the second crucial question: /Moving forwards, what
changes should I make to the style of posts, if any?/

Hmmm, this is a prickly one too. Both of these questions suffer from the
same problem — /I/ can’t answer them. Simply put, I need to hear from
/you/. Whether it be in the Reddit comments section, or by Email (`tec@'
this domain), to direct 2022’s posts I am /very/ interested in hearing
your thoughts on:
⁃ How engaging you’ve found this blog? (the content, the style of
  writing, etc.)
⁃ Whether this blog has influenced your feelings on the Org project
  and/or community?
⁃ Whether this blog has affected your thoughts on contributing to Org?
⁃ What you think this blog has done well/badly over the past year?
⁃ If there’s anything you’d be interested in this blog doing differently
  in 2022?

That’s all for now! Thank you for reading, and have a great new year 🙂
