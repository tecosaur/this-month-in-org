Dear readers, unfortunately I've been unusually busy as of late, and will
continue to be for a bit over a month. As such, it's entirely likely that the
next post or two may +be late+ make use of creative dates too.

In terms of Org development, we've had a fairly slow month --- mostly tweaks and
fixes, concentrated on the new org-cite functionality. However, there have been
big developments with Roam as of late.
* [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][Org-roam v2]]

Pushed to the sidelines by last month's hugely significant citations
announcement was the release of Org-roam v2 🎉. The project's author Jethro
wrote a nice [[https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/org_roam_v2/][blog post]] outlining the major changes and motivations, and so I'll
leave him to speak on that. Suffice to say, the idea of org-roam has been
refined into a form that should better server tinkerers looking to build off Org
roam, and make maintenance easier --- thus improving the user experience in the
long term 🙂. Should you be worried that the v1 -> v2 upgrade will be painful,
read [[https://macowners.club/posts/org-roam-v2-doesnt-hurt/][Org-roam v2 doesn't hurt]], relax, and try the upgrade wizard.

Within a month of Roam v2's announcement, we were pleasantly surprised by the
release of [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-server][org-roam-server]] usurper --- org-roam-ui.

While org-roam-server remains incompatible with Roam v2, org-roam-ui is built
around v2 from the ground up. With this shift comes a much more ambitious set
of features. The graph view itself is now based on [[https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph][react-force-graph]], which
allows for both 2D and 3D views of the graph, with WebGL acceleration.

Using [[https://github.com/ahyatt/emacs-websocket][emacs-websocket]], org-roam-ui establishes a two-way connection between
Emacs and the Web visualisation. This allows for nifty features like syncing the
graph view and the currently open roam file in Emacs. Furthermore, with
=xwidget-webkit= you can even embed org-roam-ui /inside/ Emacs![fn:1]

Beyond this, org-roam-ui also provides a number of other nice features, such as
filtering and theme syncing, with more in the works. To see more, check out the
=README= published on GitHub.

//github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui/

[fn:1] I have found the =xwidget-webkit= experience quite unstable until I
started using Emacs 28 with the pure-GTK branch. So, if you're not getting a
good experience now, there's a good chance you'll have a better experience in
the future.
* New ConTeXt exporter

We've long been able to export to LaTeX files with =ox-latex=, but now you can
export to ConTeXt too with [[https://github.com/Jason-S-Ross/ox-context][ox-context]]! While only just released, a lot of work
has already gone into this --- with development starting almost a year ago by the
commit history.

//github.com/Jason-S-Ross/ox-context

It's always nice to see more export options for Org, and I wish Jason all the
best in developing =ox-context=.
